# README
This project is a fork of [GraphTSNE](https://github.com/leowyy/GraphTSNE) by [Leow Yao Yang](https://github.com/leowyy). 
I just slightly updated it for newer Python, Sklearn and PyTorch versions. 
I have no intention in maintaining it in the long run.

   <b>GraphTSNE on the Cora Citation Network</b>
</p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Codes
The code `demo_notebook.ipynb` creates a visualization of the Cora citation network using GraphTSNE. The original Cora dataset and other citation networks can be found here: http://linqs.cs.umd.edu/projects/projects/lbc/.

The notebook takes roughly 3 minutes to run with GPU, or 8 minutes with CPU.

## Installation
   ```sh
   # Install Python libraries using conda
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate graph_tsne
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name graph_tsne --display-name "graph_tsne"

   # Run the notebook
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   
### When should I use this algorithm?
For visualizing graph-structured data such as social networks, functional brain networks and gene-regulatory networks. Concretely, graph-structured datasets contain two sources of information: graph connectivity between nodes and node features.
